# Gready-Heuristic-Nearest-Neighbour-Algorithm-

Gready Heuristic (Nearest Neighbour Algorithm) using Java

The goal of this project is to demonstrate Travelling Salesment Problem (TSP) with using nearest neighbour algorithm. 

There is a text file which contains cities in world. Every city has a name, latitude and longitude values. We are reading these data in our program. We are setting our starting position is Istanbul. The purpose of the project is to start travelling from our starting position to travel the nearest cities. To find the nearest city, we are using latitute and longitude values and transform them to kilometers with using a math formula. We have to reach the closest city without revisiting any of the previous cities that we visited. After every city has been visited, we will go back to our starting position which is Istanbul. We are collecting the km details everytime we traveled and calculate the total distance.
